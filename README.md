### Basics

To learn the basics of Ruby, I used the LinkedIn Learning course ["Ruby Essential Training Part 1: The Basics"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ruby-essential-training-part-1-the-basics/). The [`basics`](/basics) folder contains all the files/scripts that I created along with the course.
